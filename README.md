Dungeon Master discord bot.

Welcome to my project. This is a private project and that any code that is used, forked, referenced, or any ideas that are taken from here without my approval is forbidden.

# Intro
Dungeon Master Bot™©

The purpose of Dungeon Master Bot™© is to make an interactive discord where users can play an rpg style game in
a server that the bot has full control over.

How will it be played?

Similar to other text based games or other RPG style games, this bot will use the traditional RPG turn based system
when it comes to combat. Users will enter commands into channels, that are dedicated to the player themselves, for
an uninterrupted experience. These commands will allow the user to control their character based on the scenario.

Things that the bot needs to do:

- Create new and user-specific dungeon text channels for the user to combat or explore areas.
- Be able to save and write character files for any alterations
- Be able to know what channel it is in and understand where the command is dedicated to.
    ie. if a channel name is "Blacksmith of Alteron" and the command was !shopwares
        then the bot needs to know that it is asking for a blacksmith wares inventory than a market or spell shop
- Be able to create "time-limited" dungeons that has to be accepted by a player to that dedicated dungeon
- Bot must also be able to edit and manage text channels so that the gameplay is in a fluid motion and the user is
  not being over-burdened/overwhelmed with the amount of msgs in the channel
- Aspect that i'd like the bot to do is being able to change and manage specific msgs for a
  visual appeal to the user
- Bot needs to know what channels are part of the game and what is just a text channel
